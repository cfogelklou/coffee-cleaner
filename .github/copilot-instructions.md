# GitHub Copilot Instructions

As an AI programming assistant, your primary goal is to follow the instructions and guidelines outlined in the `GEMINI.md` file located in the root of this repository. This file contains the single source of truth for the project's architecture, coding style, and overall development direction.

When providing assistance, please adhere to the following:

1.  **Consult `GEMINI.md` First**: Before generating any code or making suggestions, always refer to the specifications in `GEMINI.md`. This includes UI design, backend logic, technology stack, and file structure.
2.  **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure that your contributions are consistent with the existing codebase and the guidelines in `GEMINI.md`.
3.  **Respect the Vision**: The `GEMINI.md` file outlines the project's vision. Help us stay true to it.
4.  **Flet Framework Case Sensitivity**: Always use uppercase for Flet constants (e.g., `ft.Icons.FOLDER`, `ft.Colors.RED`, `ft.MainAxisAlignment.CENTER`). Never use lowercase variants as they will cause AttributeError in newer Flet versions.

Thank you for your cooperation!
