- ‚úÖ Checkbox selection with bulk deletion capability
- ‚úÖ Real-time file size display with human-readable formatting

## Safety Features

The application includes comprehensive safety measures to prevent accidental deletion of important files:

### Pre-defined Safety Rules
The app includes built-in knowledge of macOS file system structure:
- System directories (`/System`, `/usr`, `/bin`) are marked as **red** (unsafe)
- User data directories (`~/Documents`, `~/Pictures`) are marked as **orange** (caution)
- Cache and temporary files are marked as **green** (safe)
- And many more predefined rules...

### AI Analysis
For unknown files and directories, the application can perform AI analysis to provide intelligent safety recommendations and explanations.

## Installation

### Option 1: From Source (Recommended for Development)

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later
- Git

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mac-cleaner.git
   cd mac-cleaner
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   Or use the virtual environment directly:
   ```bash
   venv/bin/python main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Standalone Application (Coming Soon)

A standalone `.app` bundle will be available for download from the releases page.

## Building from Source

To create a standalone application bundle:

1. **Make sure you're in the project directory with virtual environment activated:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the build script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. **Find the built application:**
   The application will be created in `build/Mac Cleaner & Analyzer/Mac Cleaner & Analyzer.app`
